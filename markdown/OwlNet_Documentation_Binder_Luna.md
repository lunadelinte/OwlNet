## 8. Relations (Relationen)

### Implementing and Annotating Relationships

In the OwlNet application, it's crucial to correctly define and annotate the relationships between different entities. This ensures that the data model reflects the real-world interactions and dependencies among various components of the coworking space.

#### A. Defining Necessary Attributes for Relationships

1. **User-Booking Relationship:**
   - In the `User` class, a list of `Booking` entities represents the user's bookings.
   - In the `Booking` class, a `User` attribute links the booking to a specific user.
2. **Workspace-Booking Relationship:**
   - In the `Workspace` class, a list of `Booking` entities represents bookings made for that workspace.
   - In the `Booking` class, a `Workspace` attribute links the booking to a specific workspace.
3. **User-Event (Many-to-Many) Relationship:**
   - This relationship requires a junction table.
   - Define a `List<Event>` in the `User` class and a `List<User>` in the `Event` class for this many-to-many relationship.
4. **Admin-User Relationship:**
   - In the `Admin` class, a list of `User` entities represents the users managed by an admin.

#### B. Annotating Relationship Attributes

1. **User-Booking Relationship:**
   - Annotate the `bookings` list in the `User` class with `@OneToMany(mappedBy = "user")`.
   - Annotate the `user` attribute in the `Booking` class with `@ManyToOne`.
2. **Workspace-Booking Relationship:**
   - Annotate the `bookings` list in the `Workspace` class with `@OneToMany(mappedBy = "workspace")`.
   - Annotate the `workspace` attribute in the `Booking` class with `@ManyToOne`.
3. **User-Event Relationship:**
   - Annotate the relationship in both the `User` and `Event` classes with `@ManyToMany`.
4. **Admin-User Relationship:**
   - Annotate the `users` list in the `Admin` class with `@OneToMany(mappedBy = "admin")`.

#### C. Serialization of Entities with Relationships

- Ensure that all entities, especially those with relationships, are serializable.
- Be mindful of issues such as the Hibernate N+1 problem and lazy loading strategies.
- Utilize appropriate JSON serialization and deserialization strategies, especially for handling many-to-many relationships effectively.

#### Java Code Example for Entity Relationships

```
javaCopy code
@Entity
public class User {
    // Other attributes...

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "user")
    private List<Booking> bookings;

    // Getters and Setters...
}

@Entity
public class Booking {
    // Other attributes...

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "user_id")
    private User user;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "workspace_id")
    private Workspace workspace;

    // Getters and Setters...
}

@Entity
public class Workspace {
    // Other attributes...

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "workspace")
    private List<Booking> bookings;

    // Getters and Setters...
}

@Entity
public class Admin {
    // Other attributes...

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "admin")
    private List<User> users;

    // Getters and Setters...
}
```

This section of the documentation has been meticulously prepared to guide the implementation of relationships between entities within the OwlNet application. By adhering to these guidelines, the application's data model will be robust, efficient, and reflective of the actual operational dynamics of the coworking space.

  import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;
  import io.quarkus.test.security.TestSecurity;
  import org.junit.jupiter.api.Order;
  import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
  import org.junit.jupiter.api.TestMethodOrder;
  import org.junit.jupiter.api.MethodOrderer.OrderAnnotation;
  import static io.restassured.RestAssured.given;
  import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.is;
  import io.quarkus.test.h2.H2DatabaseTestResource;
  
  @QuarkusTest
  @QuarkusTestResource(H2DatabaseTestResource.class)
  @TestMethodOrder(OrderAnnotation.class)
  public class UserResourceTest {
  
      @Test
      @Order(1)
      public void testRegistrationSuccess() {
          given()
              .body("{ \"email\": \"test@example.com\", \"password\": \"StrongPass!23\" }")
              .contentType("application/json")
              .when().post("/users/register")
              .then()
              .statusCode(200);
      }
  
      @Test
      @Order(2)
      public void testRegistrationFailure() {
