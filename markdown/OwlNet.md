# 2. Planning the Persistence Layer (Persistenzschicht planen)

## 4. Domain Class Diagram (Fachklassendiagramm)

The Domain Class Diagram for "OwlNet – AI-Powered Coworking Space" will be designed to meet the following criteria:

### Understanding a Domain Class Diagram
- A Domain Class Diagram, or "Fachklassendiagramm," is a UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram that focuses on the classes which form the application's persistence layer.
- These classes, often referred to as Entity, Model, or Domain classes, represent the structure of data and how it's stored, similar to tables in a database.
- The diagram visualizes entity classes (without methods), their attributes, and the relationships between them.

### Criteria for the Domain Class Diagram

#### A. Entity Data Accommodation
- Each entity class should be capable of storing data as required by the functional and non-functional requirements of the project.

#### B. Data Normalization
- Data within the entity classes should be normalized to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

#### C. Establishment of Relationships Between Entities
- Clear relationships between different entities should be established, reflecting the logical connections within the coworking space management system.

#### D. Multiplicity of Relationships
- The multiplicity for each relationship should be specified, indicating how many instances of one entity class can be associated with instances of another entity class.

### Scoring Criteria
- **3 Points:** All criteria (A, B, C, and D) are met.
- **2 Points:** Three of the four criteria are met.
- **1 Point:** Two of the four criteria are met.
- **0 Points:** The deliverable was not submitted, was submitted late, in the incorrect format, or less than two criteria were met.

> Note: The actual Domain Class Diagram should be created using a UML tool based on these guidelines. It should visually represent entity classes like 'Member,' 'Booking,' 'Workspace,' etc., and their relationships, without including methods but focusing on attributes and relationships.
